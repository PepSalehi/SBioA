      "## About the course \n",
      "\n",
      "The development of algorithms in structural bioinformatics requires knowledge in biology, physics, chemistry, mathematics and computing. Concepts from linear algebra, numerical methods and programming are usually absent in the curricula of life-sciences. This course is intended as an introduction to those topics motivated by the implementation of common/classical Structural Bioinformatics algorithms.\n",
      "\n",
      "The course's material consist of IPython notebooks and the course is mainly hands-on. I hope this format will help students to engage in the topics and most important to continue studying on their own.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the course we will visit several classic algorithms in bioinformatics. Each algorithm will be explained in conceptual terms, followed by their implementation using the Python programming language. It is a requisite for the course to be familiar with this programming language. A good introduction to Python can be found [here](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/). Any prior knowledge of scientific libraries like NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, etc is not required. These libraries will be presented during the course."

      "Historically, science has been divided into experimental and theoretical knowledge (or empirism and rationalism). Consequently, a great number of studies in the philosophy of science have been dedicated to the inter-relationship of this two modes of doing science. During the last few decades computing has emerged as a very important part of science and by doing so it have disrupted this two-side view of science. \n",
      "\n",
      "Computer simulation have emerged as a [third scientific practice](http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/S/bo9003670.html) that while is related to theoretical knowledge _is not just theory_ as involves elements from more than one theory or that are not part of any theory (like approximations, domain-knowledge-intuition an even _fictions_), and at the same time it also has many characteristics in common with experiments. After all simulations are used in general when experimental or observational data from a phenoma is sparse.\n",

      "## Reproducible research  \n",
      "\n",
      "Reproducible Research is the idea that scientific papers must be published not only with the results and methods, but with the data (raw and processed) and the code used for analysis and/or simulation/modeling. This would facilitate the analysis and verification of results and also facilitate further progress.\n",
      "\n",
      "The scientific data and analysis are increasingly complex so simple descriptions in the style of _materials and methods_ become increasingly complicated to explain and to understand, making them unsuitable. Reducing the barriers for third parties to check the data, first would reduce fraud and will also contribute to the validation of data and published results and finally facilitate the construction of new ideas and analysis from the data and results already published.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is important to note that much of the literature the terms _replication_ and _reproducibility_ are used interchangeably and to add confusion some authors establish a difference in those terms, but some authors call _replication_ to what others call _reproducibility_  \n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking specifically of computing disciplines we can say that:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Replication: The author of a scientific article that involves numerical calculations should be able to run repeatedly simulations and analysis will always get the same (or equivalent) results. Another scientist must also be able to perform the same calculations and get the same results, given the information provided in the publication.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Reproducibility: Using an independent implementation of the method, or using a totally different method the same results as in the original publication are obtained.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are still no well-established guidelines for how it should be handled the source code, data generated (and raw data). For example, it is relatively rare that the source code used in simulations becomes available to readers along with the published article. Furthermore, it is common that the source code is regarded as a competitive advantage and therefore not made public.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, this view has begun to be questioned, some scientific publishers and individual scientist have called for greater transparency in the computational sciences. Some journals have begun to require authors to make the source and/or raw data used in publications available upon request.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is also under discussion how to facilitate the distribution of scientific software as a supplementary material.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bottom line: A solid scientific study must be reproducible, and replicable.\n",
      "\n",
      "To achieve these objectives, it is necessary:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Keep and take note of exactly which source code and version was used to produce data and figures in published papers.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Record information of the environment and which version of external software did you use.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Make sure that old codes and notes are backed up and kept for future reference.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Be ready to give additional information about the methods used, and perhaps also the simulation codes, to an interested reader who requests it (even years after the paper was published!).\n",
      "\n",
      "* Ideally code should be published online (like on github[https://github.com]), to make it easier for other scientists to access it."

For example,  if the running time of an algorithm is $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ it means that increasing the input one unit will increase the running time of the algorithm by a quadratic factor.

As an example, the  sorting algorithm Bubblesort have complexity $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ (there are faster sorting algorithms), but if the input is already sorted the running time is $\\mathcal{O}(n)$. Since generally we want to sort unsorted items it is a better idea to report the upper-bound."

These are are the very hardest $NP$ problems, no one has found a polynomial-time algorithm that could solve any of these problems. The most famous $NP$-complete problem is the [Traveling Salesman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) problem. An efficient solution to any $NP$-complete problem would imply $P = NP$ and an efficient solution to every $NP$-complete problem. Notice that as $NP$-hard are not necessary in NP if $P = NP$ does not necessary implies that NP-hard problems can be solved in polynomial time.\n",

      "What would implies that $P = NP$? Well from the practical point of view nothing, unless we also find an algorithm for solving $NP$-complete problems. In that case cryptography could become impossible (and with that secure Internet transactions). On the bright side all the $NP$-complete optimization problems could become tractable, a lot of bioinformatics problem will be much more efficient and also a lot of problem in our daily-lives, from optimization of transportation to the design of new material and the weather and climate predictions.\n",

Well, no. First of all because all the theory behind $NP$-completeness describes how algorithms perform on the worst-case scenario. However, instances of the problems that we found in practice could be easier to solve. Also, for a lot of problems we could use approximate solutions or we can use previous knowledge and various heuristics to solve $NP$-complete problems.\n",

      "### Algorithm Design Techniques  \n",
      "\n",
      "Different algorithms applied to very different problems often have recurrent patterns. It seems likely that there are only a few useful basic techniques for solving problems. The most common types of algorithms are:\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Brute force   \n",
      "\n",
      "This type of algorithms are the simplest one and consists on examining all the possibilities.\n",
      "If you want to use brute force to find the lowest energy conformation of a molecule (like in protein folding), you will list every possible conformation, compute its energy and choose as the solution the one with the lowest energy. This method guarantee that you will found the correct solution (_i.e_ the lowest energy conformation, of course you will need a very fast computer (or a longer-lasting universe), as the [Levinthal paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levinthal%27s_paradox) warns us.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Pruning (or Branch-and-Bound) Algorithms  \n",
      "\n",
      "This type of algorithm is a modification of the brute force one. And is based on the observation that for many problems it is possible to rule out wrong solutions even without computing them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead of enumerating **all** possible conformations of a molecule we will eliminate those that are unrealistic. For example, the moment we get atoms that overlaps we discard that conformation (and implicitly all conformations that derive from this one). This could dramatically reduce the searched space.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Greedy Algorithms  \n",
      "\n",
      "Algorithms, such as persons, can be greedy, but unlike persons greedy algorithm could sometimes be something good.\n",
      "In our quest of the lowest energy conformation we will start from a conformation, measure its energy and then perturb that conformation and measure the energy again. We will accept the new conformation only if the energy is lower than the previous one. Of course, one problem with this solution is that the solution is sensitive to the previous accepted solution. Nevertheless for some problems a greedy algorithm provides the optimal solution or at least a very good (and fast) approximation.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Divide-and-Conquer Algorithms  \n",
      "\n",
      "These algorithms rely on the observation that sometimes a hard problem is easier if first we divide it into subproblems, solve the subproblem individually and then combine the solution of the problem into a solution of the original problem.\n",
      "A divide and conquer approach to protein folding could be to recursively fold first small regions of the protein (e.g. secondary structures elements) and then try to obtain the 3D structure by combining the folded small regions.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Dynamic Programming  \n",
      "\n",
      "As in the case of divide and conquer algorithms, dynamic programing is based on the insight that some problems can be solved by breaking them in subproblems, if this is done in a naive way it is often the case that we end up solving the same subproblem many times. This is of course a waste of time and resources. Dynamic programming is a clever way to solve problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems, solves each subproblem only once, and then use the answer of the subproblems to build the solution of the original problem.\n",
      "We will discuss this technique in chapter 5, when solving the sequence alignment problem. \n",
      "\n",
      "#### Knowlegde-based algorithms  \n",
      "\n",
      "In this category I am including any method that use statistical knowledge to solve a problem.\n",
      "This technique has been extensively used in bioinformatics. For example, to fold a protein we could first collect the probability of each amino acid to have a particular combination of $phi$ and $psi$ angles (i.e. the ramachandran plot) and then use those probabilities to sample the conformational space. In chapter 7 we will briefly discuss this approximation in order to build force fields (aka scoring functions).\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Randomized Algorithms  \n",
      "\n",
      "The basic idea of these type of algorithms is to use random numbers (or more generally pseudo-random numbers) to solve problems.\n",
      "The well-know and extendenly used [Monte Carlo methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method), belong to this class of algorithms. Another type of algorithm that is also not-deterministic are the genetic algorithms. We will discuss both of them in chapter 7."
