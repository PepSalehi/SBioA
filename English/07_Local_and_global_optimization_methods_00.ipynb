      "## Speeding up Python\n",
      "\n",
      "Before talking about optimization methods and molecualr mechanics we will talk about how to speed-up Python code. There are several options, most of them follows the [Pareto rule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle).In this case can be re-stated as follows _only an small part of the code is responsible for most of the  execution time_. Hence, is generally possible to speed-up Python just by re-writing an small part of the code, you can attain that by:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Using NumPY (something we have been doing from the beginning of the course)\n",
      "* Write the slow portion using a fast/compiled programming language like C/C++ or Fortran. \n",
      "* Use [Cython](http://cython.org/) to rewrite the critical part of the code. Cythons allows to write compiled C code by adding some minor modifications to native Python code (the basic idea is that you add variable declarations).\n",
      "* Using [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/), a Python library that allows you to define, optimize, and evaluate mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays efficiently.\n",
      "* And using [Numba](http://numba.pydata.org/), another Python library. Just adding _decorators_ it is possible to speed-up pure Python code. This is probably the easiest way to accelerate Python code and is the one we will use here. \n",
      "\n",
      "The 3 last options allows speed-ups that can range from 0 to 3 orders of magnitude depending on several factors. This means that under certain conditions it is possible to obtain similar performance to C/C++ or Fortran code. \n",
      "\n",
      "Much of the technology behind these methods (like the [jit compiler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation)) for optimization were not available when Python was invented and thus the _patchy-feel_ of this solutions. One language that was created from the beginning with all this optimizations in mind is [Julia](http://julialang.org/). Julia feels like Python but runs (almost) like C/C++/Fortran. The only drawback right now is that the Julia ecosystem is too young (at least for now). The good news is that it is possible to run Julia and Python together (see [here](https://conference.scipy.org/scipy2013/presentation_detail.php?id=203) and [here](http://jupyter.org/)).  \n",
      "\n",
      "Using Numba we just add the decorator _@jit_ just before the function we would like to optimize. A decorator allow you to modify code in functions or classes, without having to rewrite the function or class.\n",
      "\n",
      "In general Numba is smart enough to infer the type of the arguments and the type of the returned value. In case Numba fails to find out the right types you could end-up with code that is slower than the pure python code! In that case you can indicate to Numba the right types. For how to do this and other features on Numba please read the [documentation](http://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/0.17.0/index.html)."

      "\n",
      "As you see from the above equation there are a lot of parameters in a FF that should be determined, like equilibrium values of bond lengths, bond angles and torsionals, van der Waals radii, and partial charges. The parameters are determined for atoms in functional groups. _i.e._ a carbon in a methyl and a carbon in a carboxyl groups will have different set of parameters. In most common FF the partial charges are fixed. Nevertheless, polarizable models (in which the charge responds to the environment) have been also developed and how to implement them in a computationally efficient way is an intensive area of research.\n",
      "\n",
      "Traditionally, parameters were derived from quantum mechanical computations and/or experimental measurement of small compounds. One problem with this approach is that by using small compounds is hard to correctly capture the properties of large biomolecules. One good [example](http://boscoh.com/protein/the-infidelity-of-the-theoretical-protein-backbone.html) of this is the difficulty that FF historically had to reproduce the ramachandran plot. Alternative, parameters can be derived by doing statistical analysis of experimentally solved biomolecular structures. Briefly, the main idea is that the probability to observe any state of a system is proportional to $e^{(\\frac{-E}{kT})}$ (i.e. the probability of the states follow a Boltzmann distribution), where $E$ is the energy, $T$ the absolute temperature and $k$ the Boltzmann constant. Thus, we can obtain energies by observing frequencies. FF derived using this type of approach are generally called _knowledge based scoring functions_ or  _knowledge based potentials_. This approach have been used for the Rosetta force field, that includes (among others) an hydrogen bond term, a _ramachandran_ term, a rotamer term for side chains, etc were the parameters were determined directly from high quality protein structures. You can read more about the energy terms in the _score_12_ scoring function [here](https://www.rosettacommons.org/manuals/rosetta3_user_guide/score_types.html). The _score12_ scoring function, was the default in Rosetta until the talaris2013 scoring function was created, unfortunately this new scoring function is not yet [well documented](https://www.rosettacommons.org/node/3508)."

      "[Energy minimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_minimization) (AKA energy optimization or geometry optimization) is the process of finding an arrangement of a collection of atoms where, according to some model (force field, scoring function, etc), the net inter-atomic force on each atom is as close as possible to zero, i.e. the system is in a local minimum of the potential energy surface (PES).\n",
      "\n",
      "During an energy minimization the changes in the coordinates have not physical meaning. The minimization process do not produce a trajectory in the physical sense. Thus, different optimization algorithms could provide equivalent results for the minimum energy structure, but arrive at them trough different pathways.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we have already discussed, a molecule can be described by a coordinate vector $\\mathbf{r} = (r_1, r_2,...r_n)$. And the energy of a molecule can be computed as a function of its coordinates $E(r)$. And our objective is to find the value of $\\mathbf{r}$ for which $E(\\mathbf{r})$ is at a local minimum. This kind of problems are studied by a branch of mathematics called _optimization theory_. Optimization is a general term to refer to the maximization and minimization functions. Both operations are the equivalent since maximizing $f$ is the same as minimizing $-f$.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There are several strategies to find the minimum of a function. One possibility, specially useful for very complicate problems that are difficult to deal analytically, is to compute the values of our functions are different points and use the lowest found value as the minimum value of the function. We can do this in a systematic fashion or moving randomly and we can move in a continuous space or use a grid to discretize the problem. We will explore this type of solution when we see Markov Chain Monte Carlo. But know we will explore other alternatives based on using derivatives of our function.\n",
      "\n",
      "We know we are at a local minimum of a function because the derivative of the energy with respect to the position of the atoms, $\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial \\mathbf{r}}$, is zero and the second derivative, $\\frac{\\partial^2E}{\\partial^2r_i}$, is positive. This should sound familiar too you. When we are dealing with multiple dimensions people it is more convenient to talk about the gradient of a function $\\nabla  E(r) = (\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial r_1}, \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial r_2},...\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial r_n})$ instead of the first derivative and about the [Hessian matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hessian_matrix) \n",

You should keep in mind that this is a topic that could quickly become very complex such as with algorithms for constrained optimization (when you keep some of the variable at a fixed value, like constant bond length and bond angle). Anyway, chance are high that you will never need to implement you own minimization algorithm, and in general you shouldn't! Several trusted implementations already exists (like [the routines](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.html) that come with scipy). \n",

      "[Conjugate gradient](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_gradient_method) (CG) is a method that tries to avoid the oscillatory behaviour of the steepest descent algorithm. The first step of both methods are the same, but from step two onward CG will move in a direction that is a mix of the previous gradient and the one indicated by the current gradient. Several _recipes_ for mixing both directions have been proposed."
